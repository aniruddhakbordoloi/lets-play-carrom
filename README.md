# Carrom
A new game in carrom-board called Clean Strike is played by 2 players with multiple turns. A turn has a player attempting to strike a
coin with the striker. Players alternate in taking turns.

## Getting Started
The game consists of a set of rules. The rules of the game are documented [here.](https://github.com/codesmack/lets-play-carrom/blob/master/src/test/resources/clean-strike-rules.docx)

###Project Walk Through
Start walking through Tests in the project. Based on the rules documented, the [CoinHolderTest](https://github.com/codesmack/lets-play-carrom/blob/master/src/test/java/com/sahaj/games/carrom/cleanstrike/CoinHolderTest.java)
and [PlayerTest](https://github.com/codesmack/lets-play-carrom/blob/master/src/test/java/com/sahaj/games/carrom/cleanstrike/PlayerTest.java)
classes have been created first to start building the project with the rules. The [CarromBoardTest](https://github.com/codesmack/lets-play-carrom/blob/master/src/test/java/com/sahaj/games/carrom/cleanstrike/CarromBoardTest.java)
is then written to build rules for winning a game or drawing a game.
